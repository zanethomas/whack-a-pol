# whack-a-pol

## Created by Grok 3

There was one error in the generated code. Grok 3 fixed it.

The generated code was:

```javascript
const cell = e.target;
const politicianDiv = cell.querySelector('.politician.up');
if (politicianDiv) {
```

The repaired code is:

```javascript
const cell = e.target.classList.contains('cell') ? e.target : e.target.parentElement;
const politicianDiv = cell.querySelector('.politician.up') || (e.target.classList.contains('politician') ? e.target : null);
if (politicianDiv) {
```

It would be really great if someone could make graphics for the game, add background music, and create sets of politicians which can be selected to be beaten with a hammer so everyone can play.
